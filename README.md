# limited-population
Now every ped kill will lower the total population of the game. People will no longer be infinitely generated. Population returns to normal after the game is restarted.

If you kill too many random peds, there may be no one left in town but you. Can you do it?

My thanks to commugum for calculating the total population of GTA 5, and to Shagg E and Vital for the idea to implement this mod.

Installation: move all files to the Scripts folder. ScriptHookDotNet is required for the mod to work.
